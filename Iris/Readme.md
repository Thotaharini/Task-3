# AI & ML Internship – Task 3  
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

##  Objective
The objective of this task is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on given datasets to understand data patterns, feature behavior, relationships, and anomalies using visualization techniques.

---

##  Datasets Used
- **Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset**
- **Iris Dataset**

These datasets were used to demonstrate numerical and categorical data analysis as required in the task guidelines.

---

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

Only **free and open-source tools** were used.

---

##  EDA Steps Performed

1. **Histogram Analysis**
   - Used histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical features.

2. **Categorical Feature Analysis**
   - Used count plots to analyze categorical variables such as content type.

3. **Outlier Detection**
   - Used box plots to identify potential outliers in numerical features.

4. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Plotted a correlation heatmap to understand relationships between variables and detect multicollinearity.

5. **Visual Insights**
   - Written insights were provided after each visualization.

6. **Feature Importance**
   - Identified important features for prediction based on correlation and variability.

7. **Summary**
   - Final observations were summarized in bullet points.

##  Key Insights

- Netflix content has increased significantly in recent years.
- Movies are more prevalent than TV Shows on Netflix.
- Iris petal length and petal width are strong predictors.
- Strong positive correlation exists between petal length and petal width.
- Visualization helps in quickly understanding trends and anomalies.
