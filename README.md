# AI & ML Internship – Task 3  
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

##  Objective
The objective of this task is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data distributions, patterns, feature relationships, and anomalies using visualization techniques. This task helps in building strong foundations in data understanding before model building.

---

##  Datasets Used
- **Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset**
- **Iris Dataset**

These datasets were analyzed to demonstrate numerical and categorical data exploration as per the internship guidelines.

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

Only **free and open-source tools** were used.

---

##  EDA Steps Performed

- Plotted **histograms** to analyze distributions of numerical features  
- Used **count plots** to analyze categorical variables  
- Applied **box plots** to identify potential outliers  
- Created a **correlation heatmap** to understand feature relationships and multicollinearity  
- Wrote **insights after each visualization**  
- Identified **important features for prediction**  
- Summarized findings in **clear bullet points**

---

##  Key Insights

- Netflix content has increased significantly in recent years  
- Movies are more prevalent than TV Shows on Netflix  
- Iris petal length and petal width are strong predictive features  
- Strong positive correlation exists between petal length and petal width  
- Visualization makes it easier to identify trends, relationships, and anomalies
