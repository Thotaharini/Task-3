# AI & ML Internship – Task 3  
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

## Objective
The goal of this task is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data patterns, relationships, and feature behavior using visualization techniques.

---

##  Datasets Used
- Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset  
- Iris Dataset  

---

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

Only free and open-source tools were used as per the guidelines.

---

##  EDA Steps Performed
- Plotted histograms to analyze numerical feature distributions  
- Used count plots to analyze categorical features  
- Applied box plots to detect outliers  
- Created a correlation heatmap to understand feature relationships  
- Written insights for each visualization  
- Identified important features for prediction  
- Summarized findings in bullet points  

---

##  Key Insights
- Netflix content has grown significantly in recent years  
- Movies are more common than TV shows on Netflix  
- Iris petal length and petal width are strong predictive features  
- Strong correlation exists between petal length and petal width  
- Visualizations help in easily identifying trends and anomalies
